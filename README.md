# Analysis of Customer Review data for British Airways

## Introduction
British Airways is a UK based airline that has been established in 1974. It is the second largest UK based carrier based on fleet size and passenger number. British Airways is the first passenger airline to have generated more than US$1 billion on a single air route in a year (from 1 April 2017, to 31 March 2018, on the New York-JFK â€“ London-Heathrow route). In 2020, due to the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, British Airways had to reduce its 42,000-strong workforce by 12,000 jobs. According to the estimate by IAG, a parent company, it will take the air travel industry several years to return to previous performance and profitability levels. However, 2022 saw a dramatic increase in travel, and the company now faced a worker shortage, forcing it to cancel more than 1,500 flights. I wonder if this shortage in airline workforce had impacted the customer satisfaction. In addition, analysis of the customer reviews can guide the airlines to unerstand the sectors where they can improve the service.
 
## Overview of Dataset 
I have obtained global customer review data for British Airways from 2016 to 2023.  Passengers have rated six different services provided by the airline. This includes Ground and Cabin staff, Entertainemnt, Food, Value for money and Seat Comfort. A score of 1-5 has been provided for each of these services. We also have information on the departure Country, Seat type, aircraft model along with many other information for each of the reviews.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Tableau
  
## Data Cleaning
- I have merged the review data set with another data set that had information on the Continents where each country belongs.
- I have noticed '-1' values for many ratings. I replaced -1 ratings by the average rating within each service provided.
- I have generated a new variable "Average Rating" that shows the average of all the 6 services provided by the airline.
  
## Data Exploration & Analysis 
- Explored the start and end date of the reviews.
- Explored number of reviews by Country, by Continent & by Aircraft type.
- Explored summary of the ratings for each of the 6 services and Average rating by Continent, by Aircraft type & by seat type in Python.

## Dashboard
I have generated an interactive dashboard in Tableau that consists of:
- Time series analysis displaying the average ratings & number of ratings per month for each of the 6 services and Average rating.
- An interactive map that shows the average rating individually for 6 services and overall average rating by Continent.
- 2 bar graphs showing the ratings by Continent & by type of aircraft.
- Summary ratings on the top for each of the 6 services and the overall rating.

## Results
- There are a total of 1324 reviews collected from 56 Countries, duirng a period of 7 years starting from March 2016 to October 2023.
- Among the 56 Countries, 42 Countries have <10 reviews & 24 Countries have <5 reviews. Hence, I have grouped the Countries by Continent.
- Highest number of reviews were provided from Europe (1009 reviews) followed by North America (168 reviews).
- Lowest number of reviews were provided from South America  (5 reviews) followed by Africa (22 reviews). 
- Asia has the highest overall rating of 3.32, followed by Europe and North America with overall ratings of 2.92 and 2.88.
- Oceania (Australia & New Zealand) has the lowest average ratings of 2.58.
- Among the services provided by the air line, highest rating is assoiated with cabin staff service, followed by ground service.
- Lowest rating is associated with food and beverages followed by entertainment.
- Aircraft A380 has hihgest Average rating of 3.2 and A320 is associated with the lowest Average rating of 2.7.
- On average the services provided in first class received higher ratings than the other class types.
- Economy class has the least ratings (2.7) with respect to all the services, followed by Premium Economy class (2.8).

## Recommendations
- In statistics, there has to be a minimum sample size of 30 inorder to be able to make any inference. Hence, it is advisable to avoid inferences with resepct to Sounth America and Africa, due to very low sample size.
- From the time series analysis, we can notice that there is no difference in ratings before and after Covid-19.
- However, we notice very low number of reviews when Covid has started (i.e. from Apr 2020 to Sept 2021).
- The air lines can work on the quality of food and beverages and entertainment services provided to Economy and Preminum Economy classes to improve the ratings.
- In addition the quality of all the services can be improved in Oceania countries (Australia & New Zealand).
- More investigation can be perofrmed with respect to the differences in ratings by aircraft types.

# British Airways Customer Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
British Airways, a UK-based airline established in 1974, faced significant challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. As a result of the crisis, the airline reduced its workforce from 42,000 employees by 12,000 jobs. However, with the sharp rebound in travel demand in 2022, British Airways encountered a labor shortage, leading to the cancellation of over 1,500 flights.  

This project analyzes **global customer review data for British Airways from 2016 to 2023**. Passengers have rated six key services: **Ground and Cabin Staff, Entertainment, Food, Value for Money, and Seat Comfort**, assigning each a score from **1 to 5**. Additionally, the dataset includes details such as **departure country, seat type, aircraft model**, and other relevant factors for each review.  

The primary objective of this study is to assess whether the **airlineâ€™s workforce shortage impacted customer satisfaction**. By analyzing customer reviews, British Airways can gain valuable insights into **service gaps and areas for improvement** to enhance the overall passenger experience.
